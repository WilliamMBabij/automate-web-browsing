Tab Management: It manages open tabs, ensuring that the maximum number of open tabs is maintained and excess tabs are closed.
Flexible Browser Selection: Users can choose between Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge as their preferred browser.
Input Validation: User inputs are validated to ensure proper formatting and adherence to specified ranges.
Customizable Wait Time: Users can set a specified wait time between accessing new websites.
Relative File Paths: The program supports relative file paths for the list of websites, making it convenient to store the list in the same directory as the program.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling provides informative feedback in case of issues.
